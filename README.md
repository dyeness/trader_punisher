# Trader Punisher
Trader is inspired by the original quests from BSG, but I took the complexity to the absolute extreme.
  This is my first serious mod on tarqs and I took the build-up from TheMachine mod, used the file structure and some variables. From this came the problem - incompatibility of the Punisher and TheMachine, but it is not necessary.
